            predefined personalities to choose from or the option to create your own, you can shape the conversational
            style of the AI. Whether you desire a professional and authoritative tone or a friendly and approachable

            ensuring a seamless and natural flow in subsequent interactions. This contextual memory enables the AI to
            understand your unique needs and preferences, creating a more personalized and satisfying conversation
            experience.
